//Generate a random number between 1 and 100. Using the browser functions 
//prompt and alert, ask the user to guess the number. You should give them 4 tries 
//to guess the number. If they guess wrong, tell them if it's higher or lower. 
//If they guess right, congratulate them. Otherwise, give them a message saying 
//what the correct number was, as well as their list of guesses.

//Instead of using prompt and alert, you will have to use capabilities from NodeJS 
//and any external module. 
//HINT: there is an npm library called prompt that can help you with that :)
